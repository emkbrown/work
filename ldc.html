            <h1>Lunar Doula Collective</h1>
            <p>I am a member of Tech 4 Social Good, a student organization at the University of Michigan that focuses on discussing tech and social justice as well as developing skills to use
                in the tech industry for good rather than evil. I was selected to join Tech 4 Social Good's project team, which partnered with Lunar Doula Collective, a start up at the 
            University of Michigan which provides support to women facing pregnancy loss or termination at no cost.</p>
            <h2>Our Task</h2>
            <p>In order to effectively support women facing pregnancy loss and termination, Lunar Doula Collective needs a website containing information about their services, their history,
                and a volunteer management system that can be easily used by volunteers and managed by administrators at Lunar Doula Collective.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our project team split into two subteams for front-end design and back-end development. As a UX Design student, I took the lead on the front-end design team. I work
                directly with the coordinators at Lunar Doula Collective to understand their vision for their website and what message and feeling they want the site to express to 
                visitors. As students in computer science and UX Design, we looked to Professor Nikola Banovic for guidance on Human Centered Design. He guided us through a workshop
                about Human Centered Design to help us plan our meetings with Lunar Doula Collective, and create a workflow that meets our needs as a student team.
            </p>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The first step of our design process was communicating with the coordinators at Lunar Doula Collective. Our goal was to learn about the mission of the organization as well as 
                the day-to-day functions that various actors would be performing on the website. We developed personas based on these actors, which included volunteers, volunteer coordinators,
                potential clients, current clients, and community members. We discussed the goals that Lunar Doula Collective had for the website, and then began constructing our design in a 
                way that would meet those goals. <br>
                <br>This project will be continuing through Fall 2020 semester and into Winter 2021. Updates to come! <br><br></p>
