        <h1>Brand Design: Campus Cakes</h1>
        <h3>Role: Brand Designer <br> Tools/Methods: Illustrator, Squarespace, Personas <br> Duration: August 2021 - Present</h3>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In March of 2020, my business partner and friend Abbey began baking cakes to quell her boredom during Michigan's temporary lockdown. Her friends and family began to notice her cake decorating skills and soon after, she was running her own custom
            cake business out of her home kitchen. She had createad a COVID-themed bakery called made with gLOVEs, advertising her health-conscious baking practices and passion for her work. However, as her business has grown over time, she wanted to
            transition her business into something less focused on the (hopefully) receding pandemic, and more focused on her current community at the University of Michigan. In addition her current ordering system consists of a Google Form, found on
            instagram, or direct messages, also on instagram. This ordering system is not accessible to the entirety of her intended customer base, and she would like to find a solution that meets everyone's needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Statement: Made With Gloves is lacking a timeless, recognizable brand as well as a simple scheduling system for customers.</h3>

        <h3>Solution: Develop a new business name, brand identity, and website with ordering/scheduling capabilities.</h3>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>As a University of Michigan student living on campus, Abbey's customer base is centered around the Ann Arbor community. However, she started her business in her hometown of Walled Lake, so it was important to her to keep all of these customers
            in mind. Through speaking with Abbey about her past customers and intended customers with her new brand identity, I developed personas describing our new intended customer base.

        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
        <p>Abbey's signature cake design features unique toppings and a drip design around the outside of the cake. I wanted to bring that staple into her new logo. In addition, Abbey asked for a bubbly logo with an energetic and welcoming feel. I used this
            information to design the following logo, with many color variations.

        </div>
        <h2>Marketing Materials</h2>

        <p>This project is emerging. In the future I will be developing a comprehensive style guide and website with scheduling capabilities.</p>
